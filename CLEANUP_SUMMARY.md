## 🎯 What Was NOT Removed

### Essential Files Kept
✅ **All 32 source files** in `src/` - Every file is actively used  
✅ **All configuration files** - package.json, tailwind.config.js, .gitignore  
✅ **All public assets** - index.html, theme-init.js  
✅ **Documentation folder** - Kept as requested, now better organized  
✅ **node_modules** - Required dependencies  

### Why Nothing Was Removed from src/
Each file is referenced and used:
- **12 Components** → All imported in pages
- **11 Pages** → All have routes in App.js
- **4 Contexts** → All wrapped in App.js
- **1 Hook** → Used by multiple contexts
- **1 Util** → Used by theme system
- **App.js** → Main app router
- **index.js** → Entry point
- **index.css** → Global styles & theme variables
